so the aim of the first part of the project is to discriminate(seperate) 2 numbers from on another using different properties.The program is done based on speration 0 and 1 and also seperating two numbers 5 and 6.Fisher discriminant method is used to achieve more accurate classification of numbers.Training data and testing data are mentioned in the code and accuracy based on different training examples(0 & 1 ,5 & 6) are also calculated.varoius properties like Area ,Ecentricity etc are used to clasiify differences between two numbers.

# For File projectB.ipynb.
The main aim of second part of project is to apply backpropagation algorithm using nueral networks.Initialization of weights are done and forward and backpropagation algorithm is applied.Gradient descent is used to set the proper learning rate and then predictions are made.After merging different functions the training and testing models are evaluated and at the end the graph of training cost VS Number of Iterations are plotted.
